### Lab 4a: Problem Statement <a name="problemStatement"></a>

Find problem Statement under [Problem Statement.docx](Problem%20Statement.docx) file. This document is a mimic of how a customer or project owner can disseminate his idea about the project that is to be done by the Software Development team.

### Lab 4a: Premilinary Diagrams <a name="prediagrams"></a>

Premilinary Diagrams are the diagrams designed after studying problem statement to understand a baics functional requirements of the system being developed. For this propose we'll have two different diagrams.

#### Context Diagram <a name="context"></a>

Context Diagram will show how the system communicated between different entities.

#### Use Case Diagrams <a name="usecase"></a>

Use Case Diagrams will show functional requirements of the system.

### Lab 5: Analysis - Domain modeling (Class diagram) and Sequence diagram

As a part of Lab 5, we have designed Class Diagram and Sequence Diagram

#### Class Diagrams <a name="class"></a>

Look inside Class Diagram folder, this class diagram is used to show how our domain will be modeled. 

#### Sequence Diagrams <a name="sequence"></a>

Sequence Diagram folder consist of two sequence diagram showing the behaviour of two different use cases. We have covered the behaviour of Adding a car and Checking availability of car in these diagram.

### Lab 6: Architecture Diagrams <a name="architecture"></a>

We have two drafts of Architecture. First draft will give a glance of how the architecture and final draft will be more consise about the architecture mentioning several tires and layers including technologies.

### Lab 7: Design <a name="design"></a>

For Lab 7, we have the same sequence diagram, as Prof. approved out sequence diagram already validates the requirements for this lab. However, final draft of Class Diagram can be found under Class Diagram folder.
